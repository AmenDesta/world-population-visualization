World Population Visualization

This project uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to visualize global population growth from 1950 to 2025. It’s designed to be beginner-friendly and shows how simple code and charts can reveal powerful trends.

What’s Included:
A Jupyter Notebook file (population_analysis.ipynb)
Built-in dataset (no downloads required)
Two charts: line and bar
Insights and commentary in Markdown cells

What You’ll Learn:
How to use pandas to create a simple dataset
How to plot data using matplotlib
How to interpret population growth visually
How to structure a clean, readable notebook

How to View the Project:
You can view the notebook directly on GitHub — no setup needed. Just click on population_analysis.ipynb and scroll through the code and charts.

How to Run the Project Yourself:
Install Python If you don’t have Python installed, download it from python.org..
Install Jupyter Notebook Open your terminal or command prompt and run: pip install notebook
Download the Project
Click the green “Code” button on GitHub
Choose “Download ZIP” or clone the repo using Git
Open the Notebook
Navigate to the project folder in your terminal
Run: jupyter notebook
Click on population_analysis.ipynb when the browser opens
Run the Cells
Click on each cell and press Shift + Enter
The charts will appear below the code

Customizing the Year Range: 
To explore different years, edit the Year and Population (Billions) lists in the notebook. Make sure both lists have the same length. Then re‑run the notebook to generate updated charts.

Troubleshooting:
If you see an error like “Notebook does not appear to be JSON,” make sure you’re opening the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook — not a text editor.
If matplotlib doesn’t work, try running: pip install matplotlib
